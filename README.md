# SWEN221
All assignments, labs and mid-term tests I have done in SWEN221 2016

This is the first stop of my GitHub voyage. It's been fun!

This repo is just a personal backup for what I've coded in SWEN221.

Labs and mid-test from previous years are 100% correct. Assignments are at A+ level.

Pround of it.



BUT, a big BUT:

# DO NOT COPY MY CODE, LATER STUDENTS! 
I know you will search for other's work on github, cos I did it too.
You should know that YOU'LL LEARN NOTHING DOING THAT!

YOU CAN READ AND LEARN OTHERS' CODE BUT DO NOT STEAL.
