<p>If you've managed to get this far, then you've obviously setup and run the web server correctly --- well done!</p>

<p>SimpleWeb is really the most simple kind
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web server</a>
possible, and was written
by <a href="http://www.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~djp">David J. Pearce</a> on 2nd
June, 2010 at the <a href="http://www.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/">School of
Engineering and Computer
Science</a>, <a href="http://www.vuw.ac.nz">Victoria University</a>.
SimpleWeb is not
an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP
1.0/1.1</a> compliant server --- but it does at least serve up files
if you ask it.</p>
<p>The main problem with SimpleWeb is that it is
not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computer_science%29">multi-threaded</a>.
This means it can only handle one connection at a time.  You can test
this by trying to load a large file
(like <a href="images/moon.jpg">this one</a>) in a separate tab and
then, whilst this is progressing, following another link
(like <a href="shakespear/henryIVpart1.html">this one</a>).  What you
should find, is that you won't be able to load any more pages from the
webserver until that large file has completed (because it processes
them one at a time).  Obviously, if one user downloading a file meant
all other users of the same website had to wait, the internet would be
a very frustrating place indeed!
</p>
<p>So, your job with this assignment is to update SimpleWeb to be multi-threaded!</p>
