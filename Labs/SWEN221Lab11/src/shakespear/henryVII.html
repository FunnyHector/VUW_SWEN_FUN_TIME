<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.0.1">I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.2">That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.3">Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.4">Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.5">We now present. Those that can pity, here</a><br>
<a name="1.0.6">May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</a><br>
<a name="1.0.7">The subject will deserve it. Such as give</a><br>
<a name="1.0.8">Their money out of hope they may believe,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.9">May here find truth too. Those that come to see</a><br>
<a name="1.0.10">Only a show or two, and so agree</a><br>
<a name="1.0.11">The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.12">I'll undertake may see away their shilling</a><br>
<a name="1.0.13">Richly in two short hours. Only they</a><br>
<a name="1.0.14">That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.15">A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</a><br>
<a name="1.0.16">In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.17">Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.18">To rank our chosen truth with such a show</a><br>
<a name="1.0.19">As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</a><br>
<a name="1.0.20">Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.21">To make that only true we now intend,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.22">Will leave us never an understanding friend.</a><br>
<a name="1.0.23">Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</a><br>
<a name="1.0.24">The first and happiest hearers of the town,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.25">Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</a><br>
<a name="1.0.26">The very persons of our noble story</a><br>
<a name="1.0.27">As they were living; think you see them great,</a><br>
<a name="1.0.28">And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</a><br>
<a name="1.0.29">Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</a><br>
<a name="1.0.30">How soon this mightiness meets misery:</a><br>
<a name="1.0.31">And, if you can be merry then, I'll say</a><br>
<a name="1.0.32">A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</a><br>

<a name="1.1.19">The view of earthly glory: men might say,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.20">Till this time pomp was single, but now married</a><br>
<a name="1.1.21">To one above itself. Each following day</a><br>
<a name="1.1.22">Became the next day's master, till the last</a><br>
<a name="1.1.23">Made former wonders its. To-day the French,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.24">All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.25">Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they</a><br>
<a name="1.1.26">Made Britain India: every man that stood</a><br>
<a name="1.1.27">Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</a><br>
<a name="1.1.28">As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.29">Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</a><br>
<a name="1.1.30">The pride upon them, that their very labour</a><br>
<a name="1.1.31">Was to them as a painting: now this masque</a><br>
<a name="1.1.32">Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night</a><br>
<a name="1.1.33">Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.34">Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.35">As presence did present them; him in eye,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.36">Still him in praise: and, being present both</a><br>
<a name="1.1.37">'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner</a><br>
<a name="1.1.38">Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--</a><br>
<a name="1.1.39">For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged</a><br>
<a name="1.1.40">The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</a><br>
<a name="1.1.41">Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.42">Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.43">That Bevis was believed.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech7"><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.44">O, you go far.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech8"><b>NORFOLK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.45">As I belong to worship and affect</a><br>
<a name="1.1.46">In honour honesty, the tract of every thing</a><br>
<a name="1.1.47">Would by a good discourser lose some life,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.49">To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.</a><br>

<a name="1.1.51">Distinctly his full function.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech9"><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.52">Who did guide,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.54">Of this great sport together, as you guess?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech10"><b>NORFOLK</b></a>

<a name="1.1.56">In such a business.</a><br>

<a name="1.1.57">I pray you, who, my lord?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech12"><b>NORFOLK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.58">All this was order'd by the good discretion</a><br>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.60">The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed</a><br>
<a name="1.1.61">From his ambitious finger. What had he</a><br>
<a name="1.1.62">To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</a><br>
<a name="1.1.63">That such a keech can with his very bulk</a><br>
<a name="1.1.64">Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun</a><br>
<a name="1.1.65">And keep it from the earth.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech14"><b>NORFOLK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.66">Surely, sir,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.67">There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</a><br>
<a name="1.1.68">For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace</a><br>
<a name="1.1.69">Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon</a><br>
<a name="1.1.70">For high feats done to the crown; neither allied</a><br>
<a name="1.1.71">For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.72">Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.73">The force of his own merit makes his way</a><br>
<a name="1.1.74">A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</a><br>
<a name="1.1.75">A place next to the king.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech15"><b>ABERGAVENNY</b></a>

<a name="1.1.77">What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye</a><br>
<a name="1.1.78">Pierce into that; but I can see his pride</a><br>
<a name="1.1.79">Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.80">If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.81">Or has given all before, and he begins</a><br>
<a name="1.1.82">A new hell in himself.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech16"><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.83">Why the devil,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.84">Upon this French going out, took he upon him,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.85">Without the privity o' the king, to appoint</a><br>
<a name="1.1.86">Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</a><br>
<a name="1.1.87">Of all the gentry; for the most part such</a><br>
<a name="1.1.88">To whom as great a charge as little honour</a><br>
<a name="1.1.89">He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.90">The honourable board of council out,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.91">Must fetch him in the papers.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech17"><b>ABERGAVENNY</b></a>

<a name="1.1.92">I do know</a><br>
<a name="1.1.93">Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</a><br>
<a name="1.1.94">By this so sickened their estates, that never</a><br>
<a name="1.1.95">They shall abound as formerly.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech18"><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.96">O, many</a><br>
<a name="1.1.97">Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em</a><br>
<a name="1.1.98">For this great journey. What did this vanity</a><br>
<a name="1.1.99">But minister communication of</a><br>
<a name="1.1.100">A most poor issue?</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech19"><b>NORFOLK</b></a>

<a name="1.1.101">                  Grievingly I think,</a><br>

</blockquote>

<a name="speech20"><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.104">Every man,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.105">After the hideous storm that follow'd, was</a><br>
<a name="1.1.106">A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke</a><br>
<a name="1.1.107">Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,</a><br>

<a name="1.1.126">Together; to consider further that</a><br>
<a name="1.1.127">What his high hatred would effect wants not</a><br>
<a name="1.1.128">A minister in his power. You know his nature,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.129">That he's revengeful, and I know his sword</a><br>
<a name="1.1.130">Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,</a><br>
<a name="1.1.131">It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,</a><br>

<a name="2.1.17">I'll tell you in a little. The great duke</a><br>

<a name="2.1.19">He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</a><br>
<a name="2.1.20">Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</a><br>
<a name="2.1.21">The king's attorney on the contrary</a><br>
<a name="2.1.22">Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</a><br>
<a name="2.1.23">Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired</a><br>
<a name="2.1.24">To have brought viva voce to his face:</a><br>
<a name="2.1.25">At which appear'd against him his surveyor;</a><br>
<a name="2.1.26">Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,</a><br>

<a name="2.1.34">And so his peers, upon this evidence,</a><br>
<a name="2.1.35">Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</a><br>
<a name="2.1.36">He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</a><br>
<a name="2.1.37">Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</a><br>

<blockquote>
<a name="2.1.39">When he was brought again to the bar, to hear</a><br>
<a name="2.1.40">His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd</a><br>
<a name="2.1.41">With such an agony, he sweat extremely,</a><br>
<a name="2.1.42">And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:</a><br>
<a name="2.1.43">But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</a><br>
<a name="2.1.44">In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.</a><br>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech19"><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="2.1.46">Sure, he does not:</a><br>
<a name="2.1.47">He never was so womanish; the cause</a><br>

<a name="2.4.205">Or died where they were made, or shortly after</a><br>
<a name="2.4.206">This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</a><br>
<a name="2.4.207">This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</a><br>
<a name="2.4.208">Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</a><br>
<a name="2.4.209">Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</a><br>
<a name="2.4.210">I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</a><br>
<a name="2.4.211">By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</a><br>
<a name="2.4.212">Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</a><br>
<a name="2.4.213">The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</a><br>
<a name="2.4.214">Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</a><br>
